# FaceDetectAI

## 👁️ About 👨‍💻

This project aims to implement a face detection system using computer vision techniques. The system detects and localizes human faces in images, providing bounding boxes around the detected faces.

## 📋 Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Results
The face detection system provides accurate and efficient results. It can detect multiple faces simultaneously. The system's robustness ensures reliable face detection even in various lighting conditions and different facial orientations. The processed output will be displayed, showing bounding boxes around the detected faces.

The system achieves high accuracy by leveraging advanced deep learning models trained on extensive face datasets. It utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to deliver real-time performance while maintaining precision.
